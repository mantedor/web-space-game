# Build
  Before actually building, we have to install all depedencies. 
  To build, we use a custom script to copy all resources (images) that don't get copied when building through Typescript
```
npm i
npm run build
```

# Running this project
  After building the project, a new folder will be created as ```/build```, simply running node with ```/build/index.js``` will start it
```
node index.js
```
